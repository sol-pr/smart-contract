## 📌 About The Project

The Sol-PR Smart Contract is designed to facilitate the management of GitHub pull requests and distribute bounties in Sol tokens. This contract allows contributors to earn rewards for both feature implementations and bug fixes, while repository owners can efficiently manage and track their open-source contributions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

* Ensure you have Rust and Solana CLI installed on your machine.
* Set up your Solana CLI with the correct environment (devnet/testnet/mainnet).

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sol-pr/smart-contract.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd smart-contract
   ```
3. Build the smart contract:
   ```sh
   cargo build-bpf
   ```
4. Deploy the smart contract to the Solana network:
   ```sh
   solana program deploy /path/to/sol_pr_contract.so
   ```

You can now interact with the smart contract using Solana's CLI or your own client application.
